She was totally checked out and never did.\nAt the same time, my boss, our company's lead developer and tech director was also checked out. He was thinking about leaving/moving away and finding somewhere else to work. There's some amount of blame to be put on him for never reviewing the project lead's code. He knew someone should be making sure things are being done in a reasonable way, and he just didn't care. Now, months later, I am in charge of the project, and the only person who is paying for the debt brought about is me. That is not right, and I don't know what else can be done.
