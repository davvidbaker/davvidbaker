    tagline: 'VR Music Video',
    description: `In 1987, Bernie Sanders released a folk music album on which he covered the classic "This Land is Your Land". For fun, I decided to create an immersive music video for this track that features Bernie singing and dancing—it's not exactly a video, as you control certain aspects of your environment, but you get the idea. I contacted the studio that owns the rights to the song to see if I could get permission to publish this on the Oculus Store (for the Oculus Rift) and the Google Play Store (for Google Cardboard), but they haven't yet gotten back to me. Since I'm not trying to steal anyone's work or infringe on copyrights, for the time being if you want to see this you can send me an email at drbaker2@gmail.com and I can get you a copy. 

All characters, animations, scripting, and assets designed by me. Created primarily using Unity, Blender, Fuse.`
